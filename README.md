# dotfiles
My dotfiles.

## Installing
You can install these dotfiles using `install.sh`.

The script will make symbolic links from the current directory to `$HOME`.

## Making changes
If you are making changes to the files but want git to ignore them, you can use the following command;

    git update-index --assume-unchanged <file>
